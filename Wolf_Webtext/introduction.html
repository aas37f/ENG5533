<h2>Purpose of Children’s Literature</h2>
<p>Before children are enrolled in preschool, their emergent literacies begin to form through direct and indirect
    interactions with people, conversations, and texts around them (Hatton et al., 2001). One of the most important
    texts for child development is picture books. According to Lorenz Grolig’s article “The Effects of Preschoolers’
    Storybook Exposure and Literacy Environments,” the influence of picture books far exceeds simple entertainment, and
    instead “is related not only to vocabulary, but also explains a significant amount of unique variance in grammar,
    comprehension monitoring, and narrative comprehension” (1074). Educators Holly Seplocha and Janis Strasser argue
    that:</p>
<p>Picture books should be a part of every day in the early childhood years. Reading to children and engaging them in
    activities that encourage the use of expressive language, phonological awareness, and high-level thinking is
    critical for the development of the skills and dispositions that are necessary for reading and writing. (221)</p>
<p>The process of learning a language—and the implications for how it will be used later in life—is complex. According
    to Xiao-lei Wang, “children’s early language development and their emergent and future literacy development are
    closely related” (97), making the practice of reading even more crucial to the development of basic language and
    communication skills. Research shows that reading aloud is the best practice for parents when teaching their
    children the different features of the English language such as spelling, pronunciation, syntax, and the letters
    themselves, as “oral language is a key area of literacy development in early childhood” (Seplocha & Strasser 220).
    According to Wang:</p>
<p>Oral language development in preschool is directly related to alphabetic knowledge in grade 1 and reading
    comprehension in grade 3 [….] Children who have acquired a rich, everyday oral language are more likely to succeed
    in acquiring a more specialized academic language that then allows them to meet academic discourse demands in grades
    1-3” (97).</p>
<p>For young children, the process of reading is seen as what Theresa Rogers calls a “transaction” that “[invokes] a
    sense of creation of a dynamic, alternative reality—one that requires the active participation or even performance
    of the reader” (140). Students who do not easily engage with these transactions are generally not as empowered and
    do not know the strength of their own language. Children will often resist interacting with literature presented to
    them if there are barriers to their imaginative engagement, such as feeling disconnected from the plot, the
    characters, or the language. Rogers rejects the standard literary canon of children’s books and asks educators to
    instead challenge their own notions of “reading, identity, representation, and resistance” in their own classroom
    spaces by incorporating multi-cultural literature (142). This practice could increase literacy rates in students of
    color. Rogers argues that the love of textual culture starts before students are capable of reading, which is why it
    is imperative that curricula for children offer diverse characters and dialects in children’s picture books. As Alan
    Purves and Richard Beach explain:</p>
<p>Children prefer literary works with subject matter related to their personal experiences and engage more with
    materials related to their personal experiences [….] they seek out works with which they can identify, or which
    contain characters whose experiences reflect their own. (193)</p>
<p>Wang encourages educators to allow speakers of AAE to use AAE in early education classrooms without penalty, as it is
    easier to learn a “new” dialect (i.e., the academic discourse) or language when one has better command over their
    native discourse. However, if the home dialect is consistently discouraged or corrected while in school, students
    will lack a foundation of language on which to build. Without positive representation of AAE in early education
    curriculum, speakers of AAE may continue to feel isolated and discouraged from engaging in literature and
    learning.</p>
