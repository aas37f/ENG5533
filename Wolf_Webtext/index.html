<h1>Multidialectal Picture Books in Early Education Classrooms</h1>

<p>While champions of civil rights have fought for equality for people of color, the achievement gap is still one of the most prevalent forms of inequity in America. Recent findings from a 12th Grade Reading Level Assessment administered by the National Assessment of Educational Progress record that, upon graduation, an average of 46 percent of white students “score at or above proficient levels in literacy,” while a mere 17 percent of black students scored at proficient. On average, “Black and Latino students are roughly two to three years of learning behind White students” of the same age; many justify this disparity with the fact that most of the black population are not speaking Mainstream American English, or MAE, as their native dialect (McKinsey). Likewise, Black student enrollment in public school is dismal, as they comprise only 16% of the student population. This could be in part to the public education curriculum still being constructed around MAE, even though white students only make up half of all public education students. (NCES 4). Many educators argue in favor of this elevation of MAE, stating that “it is a tool for anyone who wishes to use it, and who is willing to put the time and effort into mastering it, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, cultural background, or socioeconomic status” (Jenkins). If the use of standard English is an essential tool for success in America, then a student’s potential for future success relies heavily upon the family into which a student is born. For those who use AAE as their home dialect, an early education system centered on the use of MAE acts as a barrier to literacy. The expectation that all students equally use MAE in classroom instruction triggers a disparity in early education for students of color that affects them for the extent of their academic and professional careers.</p>
<p>The insistence by educators that students use MAE over all other American dialects during instruction can result in frustration and anxiety about the learning process. If a disconnect exists between an AAE speaker’s child’s emergent literacy—a child’s awareness of reading and communication skills before they learn to read— and their formal, academic literacy, these children enter school academically disenfranchised, positioning them behind their white counterparts. Without equal representation of all American dialects in the public education system, those who do not routinely use MAE are put at an automatic academic disadvantage. This disadvantage begins in early education, when a student’s emergent literacy skills are dissimilar to the language or dialect being predominantly used in classrooms. Research shows that children respond to literature with characters that look like them, and it is likely that the same can be said for characters that speak like them (Purves and Beach 193). Therefore, multidialectal literature featuring AAE should be implemented into early education curriculum to serve the number of AAE speakers in American classrooms and to increase literacy and proficiency levels of speakers of AAE. However, while the research is there, educators and parents are hard to convince. Teacher and Scholar Jennifer McCreight states:</p>
<p>The assumed superiority of Mainstream American English (MAE) is so engrained in society that the absence of AAE goes virtually unnoticed in children’s books, and the silence of this form of speaking clearly conveys its place as an inferior means of communication. (37)</p>
<p>Great efforts have been made to implement multicultural literature into secondary education classrooms to encourage students to read, with the hope of improving literacy rates; however, the inequity starts years prior, during their formative years in early education. Waiting until high school to introduce students to multicultural literature that features AAE continues to elevate MAE and completely remove other dialects from day-to-day instruction. By that point, students have already been forced to assimilate to MAE by studying it in their text books and using it to write their essays. Introducing diverse dialects late in an educational career will only perpetuate the idea of “otherness.” To fully engage students in such a culturally-rich dialect of English, exposure to and empowerment from the literature must start at an earlier age. It is not being suggested that students only learn to read and write in one dialect: a common tongue is essential in most progressive countries. Rather, the push is to encourage educators to embrace the differences in language and dialect instead of trying to standardize speakers in American classrooms at an early rate. Doing so will encourage confidence in young learners that may incite a positive effect on literary rates.</p>
<p>The purpose of integrating diverse books into early education texts and classrooms would not be to teach students the dialectal features; rather, its presence would serve to create equitable literacy engagement experiences for all early education students. Multi-dialectal picture books could bridge the gap between a child’s “home speech” and their long-term academic experience, enriching their literacy experience and impacting the achievement gap. The implementation of practical, multicultural picture books into early education curricula and the shifting of classrooms to be focused on a more diverse student population could help students of color overcome unnecessary obstacles in their literacy and learning. I contend early education classrooms must incorporate more AAE-inclusive picture books into early literacy instruction to better support the diverse black population in American schools. However, the availability of these books must increase before it is a practical option for classrooms. Authors and educators must work together to create and integrate diverse, accessible literature to empower underserved readers and listeners in education.</p>

<h2>AAE in Children’s Picture Books</h2>
<p>A disparity in representation is clearly seen in the number of picture books available that feature AAE. On average, only 7% of published pictures books are written about a black character, and those that feature AAE in its dialogue is less than 1% (Edmonds 32). Some writers are trying make AAE in literature more accessible and less intimidating, but many educators fail to see the problem in their current instruction, which begins with the books they have in their classroom. A typical trend in picture books is a storyline featuring a black character who speaks only MAE throughout the story. Not every black person speaks AAE, but the low number of black characters in picture books who do speak AAE demonstrates the underrepresentation.</p>
<p>Noticing this problem, as an educator and owner of a tutoring company based in an urban environment, I searched for books to share with my students of color. Having heard parents complain about the lack of diversity in schools’ curricula, I intentionally sought out picture books that feature AAE in both dialogue and narration and were suitable for children ages 3-6. The results were disappointing. When the University of Illinois released a list of the top-rated children’s books featuring AAE (2010), the data collected of eighteen books only featured four books written completely in AAE. Two of those are poems by Lucille Clifton, which are too advanced for young readers and listeners. Seven on the list claim to “feature some AAE,” but it occurs mostly in dialogue between black characters. Of the eighteen books, only two are picture books, and the rest are young adult or chapter readers for students beyond second grade.</p>

<p>The lack of books that meet the criteria demonstrates just how big of a disparity there is in multicultural children’s books. Of these four books, only two—Please, Puppy, Please and Flossie— are suitable for an educational setting, as the other two are written for a more intimate setting between a parent and child preparing for bed. Even though these authors’ efforts are to have better representation in children’s books, the lack of options in the public-school setting suggests that the AAE dialect, much like its books, is made to stay in the home and away from the educational setting. So that children’s books featuring AAE fulfill the purpose of breaking stigmas and raising awareness and acceptance, they need to be made available for a larger, more public audience.</p>

<h2>AAE in the Elementary Classroom</h2>
<p>Jennifer McCreight is an elementary first grade teacher whose classroom is made up of a rather diverse group of students. In her research, she states that about half of her class is black, which is what prompted her to incorporate multicultural texts featuring different dialects. McCreight explains her goal of getting her students to reach three different “spaces” of interacting with the texts. The first would be their understanding of the knowledge she presents to them; the second space is the students’ construction of their own knowledge; and the third would be a theoretical discussion about the text, detailing their individual relationships to the text itself. Although McCreight is a rather ambitious teacher, expecting critical thinking from a group of 6-year-old students, her experience speaks to how an educator might begin incorporating AAE and other multicultural texts.</p>
<p>McCreight details her failed experiments when introducing multicultural literature to her first-grade students, stating how her students often were not knowledgeable about these readings. While they did not express any discomfort or angst while listening to the stories being read, she explains that they were silent with confusion, confirming her biggest fear that they “would have nothing to say on the topic [of the new-sounding stories]” (40). During their reading of Flossie and the Fox, her students seemed uninterested or confused, eventually tuning her out, which was uncommon for her usually rambunctious classroom. After reading two more picture books featuring black protagonists—Peter’s Chair and She Come Bringing Me That Little Baby Girl—the students began to make connections between the texts that McCreight was presenting.</p>
<p>The students initially noticed the skin color of the characters and asked if it was the same character in both books. The students then moved on to noticing similarities in how the characters spoke in each of the books. One white student mentioned that the people said things “in a funny order” (42). The student admitted that she sometimes got confused and said it in that order, too, so she still knew what the character in the book was trying to say. McCreight continued this conversation by asking the students if “A) the words sound funny, B) the words sound fine, or C) I’m not sure” (42). The voting was split down the middle between A and B, with no one race of student voting in any particular way.</p>
<p>The students’ comments “snowballed” from there mentioning similarities between the book characters and their speech, and some even went as far to comment on how different the Fox’s speech sounded when compared to Flossie (42). At this point, the students had moved into the second space of interaction with the text. McCreight decided to push a little more and ask the students to try to define their own speech—whether they sounded more like the Fox or Flossie. McCreight describes the students’ hands “shooting up into the air” with insight into their own speech (42). The students began to label their dialect as “black” or “white” without any guidance from McCreight (43). While the students were separating themselves into distinct groups, one student got a little uncomfortable with the system, arguing that “‘as long as people understand us when we talk to them, that’s what is important’” (44). The students had entered the third space of interaction with the texts and were they able to recognize its importance to the classroom with little to no prompting from the teacher.</p>
<p>McCreight’s students exemplify how the proper integration of multicultural picture books can reshape a classroom’s understanding of identity and inclusiveness. Her approach was an ambitious one, but through her trial-and-error process, she defined the types of conversations and comments to expect whenever AAE is introduced and what systems of implementation are the most beneficial.</p>

<h2>The Achievement Gap</h2>
<p>While reading is not the summation of literacy, it is the biggest piece of the puzzle. The achievement gap often leads to an “opportunity gap, an economic gap, and a racial gap” which can get passed on through generations before it gets “disrupted” (Delpit 176). One of the biggest obstacles that people of color face is that the school system is set up for them to fail from the beginning. According to McCreight, black students have not had the “luxury of attending schools that immerse them in literature which validates their lifestyle and beliefs” (36). Perhaps if the educational system and its curricula reflected realistic literacy goals and objectives, literacy rates would increase for these students. As Delpit states:</p>
<p>In part, the problems we see in schools exhibited by African Americans and children of oppressed minorities can be traced to this lack of a curriculum in which they can find represented the intellectual achievements of people who look like themselves [….] Our children of color need to see the brilliance of their legacy, too. (177)</p>
<p>As Rogers explains, children who better relate to literature and can see themselves in the stories are more inclined to believe their ability to put themselves into stories or even cultivate their own. Lisa Delpit suggests that “reading comprehension might increase amongst [black students] [….] if they are able to read more about characters whose experiences in life reflect their own and whose language reflects their own” (177). If the books children are reading do not demonstrate some type of multiculturalism or equality amongst characters and dialects, then children of the underserved population in literature are being placed at a socioeconomic and educational disadvantage from the beginning. In providing students with literature that reflects their own culture and dialect, the educational system would be validating their speech and reinforcing their emergent literacy as they evolve into intermediate or advanced readers and writers.</p>
<p>There is the skepticism about the value of implementing AAE into classrooms, mainly if it would be beneficial or detrimental to a student’s literacy and success in school. I contend the benefits of introducing multicultural picture books containing AAE to students from a young age can increase black literacy overall. The question then turns to how those students will function in academic discourses if their sole dialect is AAE. Codeswitching is a solution provided by pedagogical scholars, such as Delpit and Wheeler (1995, 2006). However, educators that push against the idea of codeswitching as they believe it echoes the same “phony logic behind Jim Crow legislation” (Young 53). Young argues that this “double consciousness” (52) scholars are suggesting that black students develop reinforces the stigma behind one dialect being superior or correct. To Young and educators like him, the idea that “separate is inherently unequal” applies to language and dialect, too (53).</p>
<p>Students themselves are skeptical of codeswitching, as well. As Suresh Canagarajah writes in his essay “The Place of World Englishes in Composition”:</p>
<p>Though [codeswitching] is a pragmatic solution that is sensitive to the competing claims in this debate [….] I have experienced certain difficulties in implementing this approach. I have found that minority students are reluctant to hold back their [own version of English] even for temporary reasons. (597)</p>
<p>To solve this problem, Young argues for the implementation of code-meshing, or the act of using one’s own dialect while maintaining readability. Many educators believe this supports a student’s right to “their own language—to the dialect that expresses their family and community identity, [and] the idiolect that expresses their unique personality” (60). The idea of “all-American dialects [being] building blocks of standard English” (61) supports this notion of incorporating more diverse dialects into schools, as each one is of equal value to MAE. When students are encouraged to keep their own voice in their writing, it becomes less of a chore and more of a means to self-expression and validation encouraging more students of color to practice reading and writing. The student in McCreight’s class said it best: “As long as people understand us when we talk to them, that’s what is important” (44).</p>
<p>While many argue that it would be best for students to use their own dialects sometimes, while adhering to the standards of MAE during professional or academic settings, the issue is that separateness can be dangerous and detrimental to the mission of equality. Students who speak a different dialect will still be placed at a disadvantage if they are unable to recognize when to code-switch and are punished for it. Demanding that students code-switch and use their own dialect “only when appropriate” reinforces the false superiority of MAE and inferiority of every other American dialect; separate but equal is inherently unequal. The goal of communication and language is to convey thoughts and feelings to those that need to understand them.  Code-meshing is the alternative that promotes students using their own dialect, while ensuring that written pieces are still understandable and intelligible to others. Instilling understanding and acceptance of varying dialects from an early age promotes this initiative of ensuring that all writers get to keep their voice in their writing.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Students of color are not the only ones that suffer from the lack of multiculturalism. Psychologists suggest that “young children perceive race differences and form racial attitudes at an early age” (Edmonds 30). It is suggested in this research that picture books that include different cultures and features of the language demonstrated would “help young children see more than ‘fragments’ of minority characters” (30). This supports the argument that “young children who are exposed to individual images of minorities find it more difficult to maintain negative attitudes on the basis of race” (31). The social trajectory of students who are exposed to multiculturism in literature would perhaps be the same of those who are exposed to different dialects at a young age in that they might be more tolerant of the dialects in the future, or at least have some basis for understanding them. While the intention of read-aloud and picture books vary, their main purpose is to teach language and its nuances. AAE does not have a standard orthography or grammar, so teaching students to have a better command of the dialect would not be the intention. Rather, these books would and should be introduced into schools’ curricula in order to desensitize students to hearing the “other” dialects of the English language; these would help lessen, if not eradicate, the social and racial biases associated with certain dialects.</p>
<p>Books featuring AAE are not as prevalent in classrooms as those featuring MAE due to the various barriers that arise from their integration. Nonetheless, they should be regularly featured and presented to students just as any other book featuring MAE would be introduced. Unfortunately, with these books remaining both inaccessible and nonexistent, educators do not have the means to reach equality within their classrooms. The education system is in dire need of authors to write and create diverse stories and characters that early education students can relate to. Since early education has such a great impact on the formation of student literacy, the disparity in accessible children’s books featuring AAE only furthers the achievement gap in students in color.</p>
<p>If early education curriculum continues to be tailored around students of a certain color, then entire demographics of students will be academically disenfranchised in their owns schools. Education must become more equitable in their approach to serving students of color, working with authors and writers of curriculum to construct literary experiences that benefit all students, not just those that speak MAE as their first dialect. Without this inequitable approach, students of color will continue to be isolated by the content of their curriculum and refrain from engagement with the texts placed in from of them. If they are to engage with reading to the extent of becoming readers and writers themselves, they need to see “the brilliance of their legacy, too” in the books that they read from an early age (Delpit 177). The implementation of multidialectal picture books would function as a means of empowerment through representation, allowing students of color that do utilize AAE to see the importance of their own voices; likewise, speakers of MAE would be exposed to a culturally-rich variety of English. ¬¬¬This research shows that, while not well seeded for direct language instruction, the reading of picture books featuring AAE in early education classrooms could positively affect the literacy rates in students of color. In cultivating a culturally-inclusive learning environment that benefits all early education students, classrooms could better support diverse learners and work to close the racial achievement gap in America.</p>
