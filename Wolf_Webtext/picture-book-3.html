<h1>Flossie and the Fox</h1>

<p>Patricia C. McKissak’s Flossie and the Fox (1986), although intended for a slightly older audience of 5-8 years of
    age, functions well as an early education read-aloud as its dialogue is rather complex. The main characters,
    Flossie, who speaks AAE, and the fox, who speaks very proper MAE, converse about why Flossie cannot recognize the
    fox as a fox (which ends up being a trick to get him to follow her to his demise by the blood hounds). The narration
    features classic AAE elements, such as in the clipping of the gerund in “Big Mama stopped sortin’ her peaches” and
    the occasional omission of the past tense, such as in “she say, reaching behind her.” Flossie’s speech typically
    omits any conjugation of the verb “to be” other than the word be, seen in “I be Flossie” and “I reckon I don’t know
    who you be.” She also changes her second-person pronouns from you to ya or yo, such as in “You sho’ think a heap of
    yo’self” and “Why should I be scared o’ ya?”. She also removes voiced and unvoiced dentals from the ends of her
    words, saying “you aine no fox” (ain’t) and “I am just a chile” (child). AAE is reflected both in Flossie’s speech
    and the narration of the story, which makes the Fox’s MAE dialect distinctly out of place. Only Flossie and her
    mother speak AAE, elevating the dialect above MAE; the failure of the fox sets the girl’s knowledge above the fox’s—
    and in turn, her dialect above MAE.</p>
