<h1>Honey Baby Sugar Child</h1>

<p>Alice Faye Duncan’s Honey Baby Sugar Child (2005) is a stand out in the collection as it uses AAE in the book’s
    dialogue and narration. Written from a mother’s point of view, Duncan pens a simple love letter to a child, with
    many of the phrases ending in “Honey baby sugar child, Lord knows I love you so.” Throughout the book, standard AAE
    features are used like the omission of the verb are, such as in “You the star in my crown. You the joy in my smile.
    You the angel in my dreams.” Duncan also follows the pattern of clipping the ends of words by turning the
    second-person possessive your into yo, turning the second-person singular you into ya, changing going to into gone,
    and turning the gerund ing into -in’. This book, whose muted colors and blurred edges act to calm the mind of a
    sleepy child, is meant for night time reading. The pages are filled with the physical acts of affection that a
    parent would offer before bedtime. The narrator addresses the child and says that she wants to “hold ya, rock ya,
    swing ya in my arms” and ends the story with a promise that she will “always be yo sweet ma’dear” providing the
    reader and listener with words of comfort before bed.</p>
